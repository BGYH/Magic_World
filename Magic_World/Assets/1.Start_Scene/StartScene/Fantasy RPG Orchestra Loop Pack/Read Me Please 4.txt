Thank you for purchasing my Fantasy RPG Orchestra Music Pack!

This pack contains 11 loopable, orchestral fantasy music tracks (16-bit, 44.1kHz wav files). 

These tracks are perfect for adventure rpgs and fantasy games, particulary if the developer is inspired by titles like Soulsborne, Hollow Knight, or Breath of the Wild. 
If you end up using these tracks in one of your games, please send me an email so I can follow and signal boost your game!
